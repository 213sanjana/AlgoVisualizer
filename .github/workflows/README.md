# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows that help maintain the AlgoVisualizer repository.

## ü§ñ Active Workflows

### 1. Auto Unassign Stale Issues
**File**: `auto-unassign-stale-issues.yml`  
**Schedule**: Daily at 9:00 AM UTC  
**Purpose**: Automatically unassigns contributors from issues after 7 days of inactivity

**Features**:
- 5-day warning notification
- 7-day automatic unassignment 
- Checks for linked PRs before unassigning
- Respects exempt labels (`wip`, `on-hold`, `priority-high`, etc.)
- Detailed logging and reporting

### 2. Test Auto Unassign (Manual)
**File**: `test-auto-unassign.yml`  
**Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch  
**Purpose**: Test the auto-unassignment logic without making actual changes

**Options**:
- Dry run mode (default: enabled)
- Configurable warning/unassignment days
- Detailed analysis and reporting

### 3. Issue Creation Messages
**File**: `issue-create-automate-message.yml`  
**Trigger**: When new issues are opened  
**Purpose**: Welcome new contributors with helpful information

### 4. PR Creation Messages  
**File**: `pr-create-automate-message.yml`  
**Trigger**: When new PRs are opened  
**Purpose**: Thank contributors and provide review guidance

## üîß Configuration

### Auto-Unassignment Settings
The auto-unassignment workflow can be customized by editing the workflow file:

```yaml
# Timing (in days)
WARNING_DAYS: 5      # Warning notification 
UNASSIGN_DAYS: 7     # Automatic unassignment

# Exempt labels (issues with these labels won't be unassigned)
EXEMPT_LABELS: ['on-hold', 'wip', 'priority-high', 'priority-critical']
```

### Testing
Use the test workflow to validate changes before they affect real issues:

1. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Test Auto Unassign (Manual)"
2. Click "Run workflow" 
3. Configure test parameters
4. Review the output logs

## üìä Monitoring

All workflows provide detailed logging accessible through the Actions tab. Key information includes:
- Number of issues processed
- Actions taken (warnings, unassignments)
- Issues skipped and reasons
- Error reporting

## üöÄ Benefits

- **Improves contributor flow**: Makes issues available for active contributors  
- **Maintains engagement**: Gentle reminders encourage regular updates
- **Respects priorities**: High-priority and work-in-progress issues are protected
- **Full transparency**: Complete audit trail of all automated actions
